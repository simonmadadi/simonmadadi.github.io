                               <p>I'm an interaction design student at Sheridan college in Oakville. I like to snowboard, cook and play with my dog as much as I possibly can. I enjoy creating all sorts of different things but I'm most interested in graphic design, UI/UX design and user research.</p>
                            
                                <p>I think that the most important part of designing anything good is to know who you are designing for.</p>

                                        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                                        <p>For this project I was tasked with designing a user interface for a music application. This project was intended to focus on user goals as the starting point for the research.</p>
                                        <h3>Process</h3>
                                        <p>I began this project by conducting research surrounding music applications. I created a survey with a group of 7 music application users that gave me a rough understanding of their behavioral variables. I then continued my research by creating personas surrounding users for this application. This step allowed me to get a better understanding of who I would be designing for.</p>
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                
                                 <div class="col-md-6 text-left">
                                     
                                   
                                    <div id="tbox">

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>After conducting my research I then went on to create wireframes of the application's interface. It was at this stage that I realized the limitations of the amount of information that could be fit onto a mobile phone display, so comprimises had to be made in order to keep the usability. </p> 
                                        <p>I decided to create a navigational portion on the bottom half of the screen that would always appear to user so long as a playlist was selected. I also wanted it to be easy for users to pick a new playlist while listening to their current one so I allowed for space at the top of the screen for the rest of the app to function normally. I then finalized the graphical interface of the application after revising the wireframes.</p>

                                        <p>For this project I was given the task of taking a selected audio clip and creating a compeling video around the dialogue using typography and some symbols. I chose to create a video based off the film "The Warriors" because I've always enjoyed the dialogue fro the movie. </p>

                                        <p>Creating a video in After Effects for the first time was definitely a challenge, but once I understood the interface better it became a lot more effortless. I also faced the challenge of the audience cheering in the audio clip and how I would go about representing that on screen. I solved this by having the cheers drown out the dialogue from the main character. </p>

                                        <p>I started this project by writing a script to outline what would be said in the video. I then created a storyboard to get a better understanding of what would be on screen at any given moment. I created my images using Illustrator and imported them into After Effects to complete the animation. </p>

                                        <p>For this project I was tasked with redesigning a cover for the book Problem Solved. I wanted to create something radically different from the original.</p>
                                        <h3>Process</h3>
                                        <p>I began this project by sketching several thumbnails that pertained to the title. I used the images that I immediatly associated with problem solving. My focus for these concepts was on the idea of solving a physical problem. I explored the idea of a problem being several intertwined tasks. After trying out a few ideas I realized that I wanted to focus my design around maze imagery. My final design uses a maze to illustrate a problem as well as the shift in mind set that is illustrated through the change in colour.</p>

                                            <br>
                                            <p>Around 14.6 billion dollars worth of food is thrown out of Canadian households annually. When combined with the fact that the average Canadian spends around 15% of their total income on groceries, we can see that there is a serious problem when it comes to how we keep track of the food we have in our kitchens. </p>
                                            
                                            <p>The causes range from simple things like forgetting what's in the fridge until the food has spoiled to never finding a use for the food we purchase. Then there is the food that we always eat and the problem becomes how can we make sure we never run out of our favourite foods when we need them the most. The purpose of my project is to reduce the amount of food we waste by visually confronting users of what they have in their kitchens as well always ensuring that our kitchens stay stocked with the food we eat the most.</p>

                                            <p>While conducting primary research for my project I spoke with two different groups of potential users. The first person I interviewed to learn about the needs they were seeking while dealing with their food was a young professional woman that had just begun working full time. She was trying to save money by cooking at home as much as possible. A problem she had was trying to keep track of all of her food. She would buy a lot of groceries and then forget about certain items that had gone to the back of her fridge or pantry. This would cause some of her food to expire before she had a chance to use it. She explained that she threw out food almost once a week and how this was a major problem for her. Another problem that she had expressed was that while doing groceries, she would often forget which items she needed to buy and which ones she already had enough of at home.</p>
                                            
                                            <p>The second interview that helped validate my project was of a baker working at a grocery store. She had explained that one of the most problematic parts of her job was weighing the amount of ingredients they had in inventory. She explained that while taking inventory, they would have to move items around a lot in order to place them on scales to get an accurate count of the quantity. She also explained that this task was time consuming. This user research validates my project statement by highlighting the primary problem users have when it comes to keeping track of their food. Users want to easily know when their food will expire and how much of it they have.</p>

They are users that forget when the food they have is going to expire and often throw away unused food that has spoiled. The users are also people that want to know the up to date quantitates of the food that they have to ensure that they always have enough to eat. Users that go grocery shopping and forget about what they have at home are also part of the target audience because they don't want to purchase items that they already have and they want to make sure that they get everything that they need. My Users want to save money by throwing away less food and they want to know if they have the food they need at all times.</p>

                                        Jane is a busy mother that cares about providing the best meals for her family. She is always buying fresh whole foods to cook with but due to her hectic work schedule she often has to throw out lots of it weekly because she just can’t keep track of all of her stuff she has and when they will expire. She tries to cook as much as possible to save her family money, but she finds herself throwing out more food and wasting money more than she would like.

Now Linda feels like she has to do as much as possible to take care of her mother Tania by ensuring she has enough wholesome food in her house to maintain her good health. She is always checking up on Tania to make sure she has everything she needs but Tania is stubborn and wants to maintain as much of her independence as possible.

After adding the information for an item, users will then select which container that item is stored in to pair the information from the container with the application.</p>
                                            <p>After the item has been added to the user's inventory, users will be able to view the status of their item. This includes the quanitity remaining based on weight and the expiration date.</p>

down to reveal the option to view items in their fridge, freezer, pantry or all of

have alphabetically, by expiration date or by the amount remaining in a smart
container based on weight.</p>
